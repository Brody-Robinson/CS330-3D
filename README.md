# CS330-3D

When starting this course and project, this process and OpenGL were completely new to me.  The tactics I learned, especially with separating and re-using classes of the objects has helped me a lot.  This is how I will continue to craft graphics in my future in computer science.  Just understanding how these graphics are rendered will play a huge part in my hopeful career moving forward.
